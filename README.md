# ðŸŒ€ clarifai-vscode

This is a hackathon project to build vscode extension that allows integration with Clarifai



## Features
- selectively add your files to Clarifai inputs without leaving your IDE or writing custom scripts
    - upload images Clarifai
    - upload text to Clarifai
    - upload folder recursively with its files to Clarifai
    - queue files / show queue

- run LLM prompt with currently open file

## Ideas for the future
- Cosmetics
    - use IDE's progress bar
    - use collapsable views and more native textareas / buttons
- simplistic labeling from within the IDE
- run RAG with any LLM from Clarifai arsenal to answer questions about your repository
    - load as much as possible from selected file into the context
        - use filesystem and recursive import statements to prioritize which files need to be added into context

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.
