# ðŸŒ€ clarifai-vscode

This is a hackathon project to build vscode extension that allows integration with Clarifai

## Ideas
- bulk add all of your files to Clarifai
- selectively add your files to Clarifai inputs without leaving your IDE or writing custom scripts
- simplistic labeling from within the IDE
- run code similarity search
- run RAG with any LLM from Clarifai arsenal to answer questions about your repository
    - load as much as possible from selected file into the context
        - use filesystem and recursive import statements to prioritize which files need to be added into context

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of ...

### 1.0.1

Fixed issue #.

### 1.1.0

Added features X, Y, and Z.

## Working with Markdown

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.
